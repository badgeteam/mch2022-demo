# mch2022-demo
The graphics tech demo for the MCH2022 badge and event

Depends on the PAX graphics API: https://github.com/robotman2412/pax-graphics

## TODO
- Describe hardware in the DEMO in a non-techie friendly manner
- Sponsor spots?

## Hardware to mention
- RP2040 microcontroller (co-processor)
- ICE40UP5K FPGA (how to explain to the layperson?)
- ESP32 microcontroller (the brains)
- BNO-055 (accelerometer, gyroscope, geomagnetic/compass)
- BME-680 (gas, pressure, humidity, temperature)

## Software to mention
- Graphics (PAX GFX)
- Microptyhon (python on the ESP32)
- AppFS (multi-firmware something something)
